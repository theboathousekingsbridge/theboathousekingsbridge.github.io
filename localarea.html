    <h2>Slapton Sands</h2>
    <p>7.7 miles</p>
    <p>On top of being an extremely picturesque and popular beach,
    Slapton Sands plays an important part in the survival of some
    of the UKâ€™s rarest flora and fauna. So if youâ€™re looking for a
    cracking beach holiday with the opportunity to do a little bit
    of exploring on the side, Slapton Sands should be on your list
    of â€˜must visitâ€™ destinations.</p>
    <h3>Slapton Sands' Past</h3>
    <p>If you like your scenery to have a bit of history then
    Slapton Sands has a very moving story attached to it. In 1944,
    the beach was taken over by the allied forces to use as a
    rehearsal area for the D-Day Landings. Unfortunately, a
    combination of poor communication and coordination, friendly
    fire, and an attack by German E-boats resulted in the deaths of
    749 American servicemen. You can visit a stone monument which
    was set in place on Slapton Sands to commemorate the ill-fated
    â€˜Operation Tigerâ€™, along with a Sherman Tank at nearby
    Torcross.</p>

    <h2>South Milton Sands</h2>
    <p>5.2 miles</p>
    <p>If you want sand, stunning scenery and the chance to see
    rare wildlife on your holiday then Milton Sands has got the
    lot. Itâ€™s set in an Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty and
    behind the beach you can discover wetlands that have been
    designated as an area of Special Scientific Interest. If youâ€™re
    looking for a chance to observe wildlife in its natural
    environment, Milton Sands is the place to come for great views
    of migrating birds, rare butterflies and much more.</p>
    <p>If youâ€™re more interested in spending time next to the surf,
    the beach has also won an award from the Marine Conservation
    Society in recognition of the clean waters and protected
    natural habitats. Seals and dolphins are fairly common in the
    sea here and there have even been whale sightings in recent
    years. So if you have any budding marine biologists in your
    family, Milton Sands is a great destination.</p>
    <p>One of Milton Sandsâ€™ biggest attractions is Thurlestone
    Rock, an arch-shaped rock that sticks out of the sea and can be
    seen from the beach. The beach is stacked with facilities
    including on-site parking and you can even bring your dog to
    the beach in the summer. In the nearby village of Thurlestone,
    which takes its name from the local landmark, youâ€™ll find
    plenty of great accommodation, a pub serving food and a shop
    for all those beachside essentials. As the sea reaches low
    tide, there are lots of shallow rock pools for children and
    amateur ecologists to explore.</p><img src=

    <h2>South Sands</h2>
    <p>6.6 miles</p>
    <p>South Sands in Salcombe is one of the most unspoilt beaches
    in South Devon. Itâ€™s located in an Area of Outstanding Natural
    Beauty in the mouth of the estuary, but donâ€™t think that itâ€™s
    all nature reserves and nothing else because thereâ€™s a huge
    range of different things to see and do all year round.</p>
  </div><img class="bigimage" alt="Panoramic photo of Salcombe"
  src="/localPhotos/salcombepanorama2.jpg">
  <div class="blurb">
    <h2>East Portlemouth</h2>
    <p>10.7 miles</p>
    <p>East Portlemouth is actually made up of a number of small
    beaches - Fishermans Cove, Smalls Cove and Mill Bay - so you
    can hunt down your very own secluded spot. All the beaches have
    won Safe Bathing status so if you bring the kids then you know
    that the water is shallow, clean and safe for paddling. At low
    tide youâ€™ll find lots of shallow rock pools, which will keep
    budding marine biologists or just kids who love looking at
    critters, occupied for hours. If you want to explore slightly
    further afield, thereâ€™s a daily ferry from Fishermanâ€™s Cove to
    Salcombeâ€™s busier beach.</p>

    <h2>Bantham Beach</h2>
    <p>5.1 miles</p>
    <p>This amazingly good beach is part of the designated South
    Devon Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty. Itâ€™s also won awards
    from the Marine Conservation Society and the coveted Blue Flag,
    so you know itâ€™s clean. You can see Bigbury Bay and Burgh
    Island from the beach - a couple of interesting locations that
    are well worth a visit. You can get to Burgh Island by taking a
    ride on the famous â€˜sea-tractorâ€™, which the kids will love.
    Bantham is shallow and sandy so itâ€™s great for families with
    kids who want to do a little swimming or paddling, and to keep
    anxious parentsâ€™ minds at rest there are lifeguards on duty
    from May to September. At low tide, youâ€™ll find loads of
    shallow pools that warm up quickly in the sun and are perfect
    for crab hunting. But thereâ€™s more to Bantham beach than just
    sun, sand and ice cream. Itâ€™s also one of the best surfing
    beaches in South Devon. The beach has got mellow waves for
    beginners (known in surf-speak as â€˜ankle slappersâ€™), while the
    mouth of the River Avon fires out enough rips and breaks to
    test even the most radical hot-doggers.</p>

    <h1>Salcombe</h1>
    <p>6.8 miles</p>

    the South Devon Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty, Salcombe is

    <h1>South West coast path</h1>
    <p>Enjoy some Easy Access Walks along and around the South West
    Coast Path in South Devon. Start Point, Hallsands and Bolberry
    Down are just some of the places with sections of the South
    West Coast Path that are much gentler.</p>
    <p>A perfect route for children, who will love this short but
    adventurous walk over a dragon's tail of spiny crags. There are
    wide-ranging views over the wide sweep of Start Bay as you drop
    down to the lighthouse at the tip of Start Point, and then the
    path travels over rock and coastal heathland to a secluded
    sandy beach, reached only on foot from the Coast Path. On a
    good day it is the perfect place for a picnic.</p>
    <h2>Visit the site of the village</h2>
    <p>In the early 1890s, Hallsands was a small fishing village on
    the south coast of Devon. It was protected from the sea by a
    beach of sand and shingle.</p>
    <p>Then in 1897 a major dredging operation began not far from
    the village. Within a few years the level of the beach fell by
    about twelve feet, and the village was exposed to the direct
    impact of high tides and easterly winds. Several buildings were
    damaged or destroyed in storms during 1903 and 1904. Some
    buildings were repaired, and temporary protection was given by
    a new sea wall, but another major storm in January 1917 caused
    further devastation, and the village was abandoned.</p>
    <p>At South Hallsands, there is a viewing platform where you
    can see the remains of the village.</p>
    <p>The loss of the village is a very well known local event. It
    is a very sad, but interesting story and a visit to the village
    before it is lost forever is well worth the effort.</p>

    <h2>Start Point lighthouse</h2>
    <p>This brilliant white lighthouse is situated on one of the
    most exposed peninsulas on the English Coast, on the south side
    of Start Bay between Kingsbridge and Dartmouth. Start Bay and
    the view from Hallsands is one of the most spectacular sights
    you will see in South Devon. The coastal path runs along the
    edge of the bay and the scenery is simply breathtaking.</p>
